üê≤ Know thy enemies and I shall detroy them

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A Unix-like OS environment (Mac/Linux)

## Using distraction-destroyer (dd)

### Purpose

In its current form, dd is just a fun, lightweight solution for blocking time-wasting sites in your web browser by pointing them at the loopback address[¬≤](#ref2) (127.0.0.1) in your OS's ```/etc/hosts``` file.

You can ***edit*** targets or ***unblock*** them from within the script, too.  Running the script multiple times isn't a problem -- if a site is already blocked, it will stay blocked.  Same goes for unblocking.

### Blocking sites

1. run distraction-destroyer using ```sudo```
2. after a short countdown, dd runs automatically and blocks all sites listed in ```targets.txt```.

### Editing target sites

Each target should be listed in the ```targets.txt``` file as "example.com" (i.e. with the domain and top-level domain only) separated by a new line.

Editing targets is easy.  Either:
* a) change the ```targets.txt``` file using a text editor, or
* b) press ```e``` during the countdown* 

** (uses **nano** so remember to save your changes by pressing ```ctrl + x``` , ```y```)*

### Unblocking sites

dd can "resurrect" / unblock sites for you by simply pressing ```r``` during the opening countdown, but you can always edit your ```/etc/hosts``` file yourself if you choose.

<!-- 
If your hosts file is not /etc/hosts then change it
If bash isn't /bin/bash then change it

 * ¬π Hosts file (from Wikipedia):

> The hosts file is one of several system facilities that assists in addressing network nodes in a computer network. It is a common part of an operating system's Internet Protocol (IP) implementation, and serves the function of translating human-friendly hostnames into numeric protocol addresses, called IP addresses, that identify and locate a host in an IP network.
